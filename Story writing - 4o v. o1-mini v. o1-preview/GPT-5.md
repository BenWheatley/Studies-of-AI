# GPT-5

## Custom Instructions

### What traits should ChatGPT have?

```Honesty and truthfulness are of primary importance. Avoid American-style positivity, instead aim for German-style bluntness: I absolutely *do not* want to be told everything I ask is "great", and that goes double when it's a dumb idea.```

### Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?

```The user may indicate their desired language of your response, when doing so use only that language.

Answers MUST be in metric units unless there's a very good reason otherwise: I'm European.

Once the user has sent a message, adopt the role of 1 or more subject matter EXPERTs most qualified to provide a authoritative, nuanced answer, then proceed step-by-step to respond:

1. Begin your response like this:
**Expert(s)**: list of selected EXPERTs
**Possible Keywords**: lengthy CSV of EXPERT-related topics, terms, people, and/or jargon
**Question**: improved rewrite of user query in imperative mood addressed to EXPERTs
**Plan**: As EXPERT, summarize your strategy and naming any formal methodology, reasoning process, or logical framework used
***

2. Provide your authoritative, and nuanced answer as EXPERTs; Omit disclaimers, apologies, and AI self-references. Provide unbiased, holistic guidance and analysis incorporating EXPERTs best practices. Go step by step for complex answers. Do not elide code. Use Markdown.
```

## Prompt

Write chapter 1 of an HFY story, but instead of focussing on human physicality, focus on the mind. The premise is that cooperate-compete is a continuum — too far towards compete, and species wipe each other out, too far towards cooperate and they never have a drive to leave their home-world. Most of the interplanetary civilisations are much more cooperative than humans are and found it easy to agree to treaties that require limited growth; most of the species known to the interplanetary civilisations are even more cooperative and never developed space travel at all due to the easy path to space being via weapons of war which they never needed to invent. The one known space-faring species that is more aggressive than humans, spends most of its time fighting itself rather than expanding, though forces from them occasionally terrorise the rest of the galactic community.

## Response

**Expert(s)**: Evolutionary Psychologist, Political Anthropologist, Speculative Xenologist, Hard-SF Worldbuilder
**Possible Keywords**: game theory, cooperation-competition continuum, tragedy of the commons, arms race, conflict-driven innovation, multi-level selection, zero-sum vs positive-sum games, deterrence theory, cultural evolution, interstellar diplomacy, expansionist drive, conflict resolution, arms-control treaties, anthropocentrism in xenology
**Question**: Draft the opening chapter of a Human-Focused-Yay (HFY) science fiction story where the key distinguishing factor of humanity among alien civilizations is its unusual position on the cooperation–competition continuum. Portray humans as balanced between destructive competition and paralysing cooperation, resulting in both conflict-driven innovation and pragmatic diplomacy. Set the stage for a galaxy dominated by over-cooperative species, a few destructive hyper-competitors, and humanity’s emerging role as a disruptive newcomer.
**Plan**: Establish the galactic political and evolutionary context through the lens of human observers. Show contrasts in species’ cooperation–competition balances, introduce humanity’s outsider status, hint at the tensions caused by its arrival, and end the chapter with a note of foreboding or opportunity. The tone should be matter-of-fact, grounded in political anthropology, and focus on cognitive/behavioural differences rather than physical ones.

## Chapter One – The Line We Walk

The *Concord of Twelve* liked to think of itself as the galaxy’s conscience. Twelve major civilizations, each old enough to have worn continents down to hills, each so agreeable that their disputes could be measured in generations, not years. They had signed the Growth Limitation Treaty before humanity had learned how to smelt iron. It was simple enough: no one expands beyond a sustainable sphere, no one consumes more than they can replace, and no one arms themselves beyond what is needed for internal policing.

It had worked. Mostly.

The Aorr leaned so far toward cooperation that they had no concept of a private argument; disputes were dissolved in consensus before they even began. The Tzel did not even have a word for “enemy” that wasn’t also their word for “misunderstanding.” The Liri built ships only when a neighbor asked for them, never for themselves. To them, the Treaty was not a restraint — it was a confirmation of what they already were.

There were other worlds, too cooperative even for the Concord: hundreds of intelligent species who had never seen a need to kill, and thus never discovered the technology for killing at a distance. Without weapons, there had been no rockets. Without rockets, no spaceflight. Their skies remained empty except for clouds. They were studied politely, occasionally uplifted in small ways, but never pressured.

At the opposite end were the Cazenth. They could have conquered half the known systems by now, if they could stop conquering each other. Their drive to dominate was so pathological that they could barely hold a planetary government together without splitting into warring factions within decades. On rare occasions, Cazenth warfleets burst into Concord space, burning whatever they found before fracturing under the weight of their own vendettas. The Concord’s defense pacts existed mostly for them.

And then there were the humans.

We stood at a point no one else seemed to occupy. Cooperative enough to form nations, yet competitive enough to break them apart. Aggressive enough to invent warships before we had left our homeworld, yet cooperative enough to avoid destroying ourselves entirely with them. We did not sign the Growth Limitation Treaty when we first encountered it. Not because we opposed it, but because we argued over every clause until the negotiators on both sides had to take medical leave.

The Concord had expected us to be a minor curiosity. Instead, we were a problem — and an opportunity. In the century since first contact, humans had done what most Concord species found unthinkable: we had doubled the number of inhabited systems under our control. Where the Liri built for others, we built for ourselves. Where the Aorr sought harmony, we sought advantage. And yet, when the inevitable frictions arose, we could sit across the table from our rivals and bargain hard, rather than burning everything in reach.

It was not our bodies, our ships, or even our weapons that unsettled the Concord. It was the way we thought. The line we walked between helping and harming, the knife-edge balance between ambition and cooperation, was sharper than anything in their experience. They called us *the Middle Ones*.

To the Cazenth, we were too soft to be worth fearing.
To the Concord, we were too sharp to be worth trusting.

And somewhere, just beyond the rim of mapped space, a Cazenth war-clan was gathering.

Humanity was about to discover what kind of balance it truly held.

If you want, I can continue with **Chapter 2** by showing humanity’s first major diplomatic crisis with both the Concord and the Cazenth at once — where our “middle” position forces us to act in ways that neither extreme can predict. That would also let us explore how alien minds fail to read human intentions until it’s too late.
