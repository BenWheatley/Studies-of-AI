* 125g unsalted butter, cold and cubed
* 75g granulated sugar
* A pinch of salt

* 1 tsp vanilla extract

For the Chocolate Topping:
* 200g dark chocolate, chopped

## Instructions

1. Shortbread Base:
   1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and line a square baking tin (about 8 inches) with parchment paper.
   1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and a pinch of salt.
   1. Add the cold, cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles breadcrumbs.
   1. Press the shortbread mixture into the prepared baking tin, ensuring it's evenly distributed.
   1. Prick the surface with a fork and bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow it to cool completely.

1. Caramel Layer:
   1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
   1. Add the sweetened condensed milk, golden syrup, and vanilla extract to the melted butter.
   1. Stir continuously over medium heat until the mixture thickens and turns a golden caramel color. This may take around 10-15 minutes.
   1. Pour the caramel over the cooled shortbread base and spread it evenly. Allow it to cool and set.

1. Chocolate Topping:
   1. Melt the dark chocolate using a double boiler or in the microwave, stirring at 30-second intervals.
   1. Pour the melted chocolate over the caramel layer and spread it evenly.
   1. Allow the chocolate to set, either at room temperature or by placing the tin in the refrigerator for faster results.

1. Serving:
   1. Once fully set, remove the millionaire's shortbread from the tin using the parchment paper.
   1. Cut it into squares or bars using a sharp knife.
   1. Enjoy your delicious millionaire's shortbread!
   1. Remember to store it in an airtight container at room temperature.
